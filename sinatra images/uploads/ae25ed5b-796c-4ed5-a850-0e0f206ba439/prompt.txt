In a dimly lit underground sewer, a sewer inspector clad in a tattered coat and holding a pepper mill stands before a stern judge. The walls are lined with eerie shadows from the flickering light dangling above. Nearby, a funeral parlor's sign glows ominously, reflecting off the damp walls. Suspended from a rusty coat hanger is a sliced watermelon, its sweet scent mixing with the musty air. The judge, peering down through a monocle, gestures towards the inspector as if passing a solemn verdict. The scene is a bizarre blend of justice and decay, a surreal twist in an underground world.
