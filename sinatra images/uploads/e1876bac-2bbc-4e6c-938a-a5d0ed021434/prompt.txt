In a grand lounge of a medieval castle, an archbishop sits regally on a velvet couch, holding a golden plunger scepter in one hand. Beside him, a shotgun rests ominously on the armrest, its presence juxtaposing the holy aura of the room. In front of the archbishop, a bunch of ripe bananas is placed on a silver tray, symbolizing the unexpected and surreal nature of the scene. The clash of religious authority, modern weaponry, and a simple fruit creates a surreal and thought-provoking image.
