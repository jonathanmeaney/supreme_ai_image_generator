Imagine a surreal scene where an atomised Vice President hovers above the sinking SS Titanic, their body dispersed into a thousand shimmering particles. Each particle bears tiny, sparkling eyes and the VP's face is fragmented yet stern. Their extremely long fingers stretch down towards the ocean, seemingly trying to grasp the massive ship in vain. Meanwhile, a colossal chocolate Easter bunny looms in the background, its sweet aroma mixing with the salty sea air. The contrast between the chaotic atomised figure and the whimsical bunny against the tragic Titanic creates a haunting yet oddly whimsical atmosphere.
