In a mysterious underground dungeon, a lone figure emerges - not a fearsome jailer, but an unexpected sight. Dressed in traditional doctor's scrubs, they carry a beach umbrella under one arm, reflecting off the shiny surface of an antique side mirror held in the other hand. Sunlight streams through a narrow crack in the stone ceiling, casting a warm glow on the sandy floor. The juxtaposition of medical profession and ominous dungeon setting leaves viewers intrigued and curious about the story behind this peculiar scene.
