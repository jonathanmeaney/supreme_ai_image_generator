In the dimly lit wax museum, an eerie scene unfolds as a plague doctor, with a beak-like mask and long dark robes, stands facing a hostage negotiator. The negotiator, holding a plunger as an improvised weapon, tries to reason with the mysterious figure. The wax sculptures lining the walls cast long shadows, their frozen expressions seeming to watch the tense standoff. Will the negotiator's words be enough to sway the enigmatic plague doctor, or will the ancient curse they carry bring doom upon them all?
