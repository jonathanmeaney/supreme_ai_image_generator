In a post-apocalyptic world, a mythical creature known as the Siege Engineer stands tall at the center of a war-torn city. Its body resembles that of a massive serpent, with scales shimmering under the eerie light of a blood-red moon. Instead of a face, it has a gaping maw with rows of sharp teeth glinting with malice. Its tail is thick and muscular, able to crush buildings with a flick. Yet what is most unsettling is its extremely long tongue, capable of reaching great distances to snatch unsuspecting prey. At the creature's feet lies a forgotten war memorial, a testament to the destruction it has wrought. In its claws, it holds a shotgun, a stark reminder of its formidable power. The scene is both haunting and awe-inspiring, a chilling reminder of the ultimate price of arrogance and greed in a world gone mad.
