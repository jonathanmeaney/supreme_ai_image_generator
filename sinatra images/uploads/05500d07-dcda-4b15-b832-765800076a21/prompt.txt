In the depths of a dimly lit dungeon, an unusual scene unfolds. A regal falconer stands confidently next to a towering oyster raker, their eyes fixed on a peculiar sight in the center of the room. There, a massive, glowing pumpkin rests atop of an ornate pedestal. As the falconer raises their hand, a majestic falcon swoops down to land gracefully on their leather-clad arm. Meanwhile, the oyster raker nonchalantly adjusts their grip on a large, rusted rake. Surrounded by the stale scent of musty stone walls, the only other object in the room is a forgotten hairbrush, abandoned on the cold ground. The air is thick with mystery and anticipation, urging the observer to unravel the enigmatic story behind this unlikely gathering.
