In the dimly lit alley of a Victorian street, a monk in his traditional brown robe stands in stark contrast to the ragged figure of a street urchin with dirt-streaked cheeks and torn clothes. The unlikely pair is surrounded by the looming shadow of a 24-hour abattoir, its eerie glow casting a surreal light on the scene. In the monk's hands, instead of prayer beads, is an Uzi - a stark symbol of protection in this grim setting. Together, they stand ready to confront the unknown horrors lurking in the night.
