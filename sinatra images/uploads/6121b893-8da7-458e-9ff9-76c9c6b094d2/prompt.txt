In a post-apocalyptic cityscape, a one-eyed illegal porter navigates the deserted streets under a blood-red sky. Carrying a battered plunger on his back and a makeshift tool belt of scavenged items, he cautiously approaches a towering rubbish pile, where a glint of metal catches his remaining eye. Among the discarded debris, a crushed Pringles tube stands out, its vibrant colors stark against the gray wasteland. Beside it lies a lone parsnip, strangely intact. The porter's curiosity is piqued as he contemplates the mysteries hidden within the chaotic remnants of the old world.
