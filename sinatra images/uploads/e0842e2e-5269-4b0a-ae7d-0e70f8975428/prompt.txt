In a fantastical world where magical beings govern society, a high priest with a golden staff stands atop a marble pedestal, dressed in elaborate robes adorned with mystical symbols. The high priest, who possesses the power to render judgments, is presiding over a hearing at the grand orphanage of the realm. Inside the ornate orphanage hall, a wise judge in a flowing black cloak listens intently to a group of orphaned children standing before him. Amidst the serious atmosphere, a colorful beach ball rests in a corner, a stark contrast to the solemn proceedings, hinting at moments of joy and innocence even in the midst of weighty decisions.
