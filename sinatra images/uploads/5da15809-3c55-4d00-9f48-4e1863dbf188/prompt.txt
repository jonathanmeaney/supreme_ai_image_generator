Imagine a luxurious lounge at a glamorous event, adorned with sparkling chandeliers and plush velvet sofas. In the center of the room stands a regal toilet attendant, dressed in a crisp uniform, offering guests mints and hand towels. On a small table nearby lays a gleaming silver hairbrush, intricately designed with delicate patterns. The scene exudes elegance and sophistication, with a touch of old-world charm. Write about a chance encounter between a guest and the attendant, revolving around the mysterious history of the hairbrush.
