In a quirky, fantastical world, picture a gross senior janitor with a hunchback, ragged clothes, and toes so long they curl around like serpents. He's standing next to an improper urchin with a single eye and tattered clothing, clutching a bowling pin like a prized possession. Nearby, an airplane flies overhead, its rumble echoing through the scene. At their feet lies a scattered bag of teeth, gleaming eerily in the dim light. In the background, a peculiar, oversized door knob glints with an otherworldly sheen, hinting at the mysteries that lie beyond.
