In a dimly lit prison cell, a surgeon-turned-murderess sits in the shadows, her eyes gleaming with a dangerous glint. Resting on the cold, damp floor beside her is a white hot poker, its tip glowing menacingly. The flickering light from a solitary candle casts eerie shadows on the stone walls, highlighting the determination in her expression. The air is thick with tension as she contemplates her next move, her surgical precision and deadly intent a lethal combination in this dark and confined space.
