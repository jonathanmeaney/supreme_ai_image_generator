In the dimly lit cellar of an abandoned mansion, a lone tramp sits cross-legged on the cold floor, illuminated by a flickering candle. Before him, the mysterious monkey's paw rests on an ornate pedestal, emanating an eerie glow. As he reaches out to touch it, a ghostly figure materializes, their translucent hand clutching a hairbrush with silken strands entangled in its bristles. The air is heavy with a sense of foreboding as the tramp hesitates, unsure of the consequences of his next move.
