In a misty, moonlit shipyard set amidst the eerie wreckage of the RMS Lusitania, a lone carpenter stands clutching a worn bag. His weathered hands carefully open the bag to reveal an unsettling sight - a jumble of gleaming teeth, reminiscent of a forgotten treasure trove. Among the abandoned ship parts and rusted tools, a single parsnip sprouts, its roots entwined with a gnarled piece of driftwood. The scene is both haunting and surreal, bathed in the ghostly glow of the moon against a backdrop of mysterious shadows cast by the remnants of the once grand ocean liner. The atmosphere is eerie yet oddly mesmerizing, perfectly framed in a cinematic 16:9 Full HD setting.
