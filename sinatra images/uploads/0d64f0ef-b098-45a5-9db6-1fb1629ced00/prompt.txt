In a surreal world, a softened maid with a long, sleek tail delicately dusts the grand ballroom of the historic SS Lusitania. Suddenly, a crazed deputy janitor with an absurdly long neck charges in wielding a mop like a sword. As chaos ensues, the maid calmly gazes at the rear view mirror, reflecting the bizarre scene behind her. Beside her, a forgotten thermos flask leaks steam, while a half-eaten chocolate Easter bunny melts in the heat. The clash of order and madness unfolds in this whimsical, peculiar setting.
