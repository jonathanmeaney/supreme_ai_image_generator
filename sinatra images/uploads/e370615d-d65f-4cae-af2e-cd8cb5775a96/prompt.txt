In the dimly lit airport waiting lounge sits a putrefied Victorian man with glass eyes, his once opulent attire now faded and tattered. His prosthetic hand clutches tightly onto an elegant umbrella, its handle a gleaming elephant tusk. The flickering lights cast eerie shadows on his decaying form, as travelers pass by, casting curious glances at this mysterious figure frozen in time. Surrounded by modernity, he is a haunting reminder of a bygone era, a macabre spectacle that both intrigues and unsettles those who dare to approach.
